# Game Packages

Each supported game has its own package folder, installer, notes, and release tag prefix.

| Game | Package | Release tag prefix | Release assets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DiRT Showdown | `games/dirt-showdown` | `dirt-showdown-v` | `EgoNet Revival - DiRT Showdown Installer.exe`, `install-dirt-showdown-mod.cmd` |
| GRID 2 | `games/grid-2` | `grid-2-v` | `EgoNet Revival - GRID 2 Installer.exe`, `install-grid-2-mod.cmd` |
| F1 2018 | `games/f1-2018` | `f1-2018-v` | `EgoNet Revival - F1 2018 Event Activator.exe`, `activate-f1-2018-events.cmd` |

GRID 2 is in early public testing. The package is available so testers can install against the hosted server; Global Challenge and Rivals now share the Friday 10:00 UTC weekly RaceNet cycle.

Future games should follow the same layout:

```text
games/<game-id>/
  README.md
  RELEASE_NOTES.md
  <primary-helper>.cmd
  installer/ or source project reference
```

Add the game to `games/games.json`, then add its tag prefix to `.github/workflows/game-releases.yml`.
